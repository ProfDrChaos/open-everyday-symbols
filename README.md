In a nutshell, this package is an open and continuously extended list of “everyday symbols” (i.e., not of a mathematical or otherwise primarily technical nature). I call it open because I ask everybody to contribute your own symbols to it. I hope that enough people consider creating their own symbols, e.g., with the help of chatGPT, and contribute them to this package.
