\title{The \emph{OPEN} Everyday Symbols Library\\[1ex]\large Version 1.1}
\author{Pascal Bercher\\pascal.bercher@anu.edu.au}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

This package is an \emph{open} and continuously extended list of ``everyday symbols'' (i.e., not of a mathematical or otherwise primarily technical nature). I call it open because I ask \emph{everybody} (i.e., also potentially you) to contribute your own symbols to it. I hope that enough people consider creating their own symbols, e.g., with the help of ChatGPT, and contribute them to this package. (Note that creating such graphics isn't particularly hard or time-intense when getting assisted by generative AI such as ChatGPT. It will take you a bit longer to create variants of the single symbol you need and to contribute your work to this package, but if enough people do this, we'll get a decent package at some point.) For further details for contributing, please read the \textsc{readme}.

Every command follows the structure:
\begin{center}
  \cs{everydaySymbol}\oarg{color-or-options}\marg{main-category}\marg{sub-identifier-number}
\end{center}
Here, \oarg{color-or-options} is optional. If no \verb+=+ is detected in the text of \meta{color-or-options}, the argument is treated as a color. The default color is black/white (all standard \LaTeX{} colors are possible). Otherwise, if there is an equal sign, \meta{color-or-options} is treated as options passed to the specific graphic you're using for further customization, for which available keys depend on the graphics used. If a symbol is too large (or small), simply scale it up or down using
\cs{scalebox}\marg{factor}\marg{your-symbol}.

Caveat: If you specify an option in the first optional argument, you \emph{must} do \verb+color=+ in front of the color, should you also want to specify a color. At least one usage of an option \emph{must} include an equal sign in order for the optional argument to get recognized as an option list, and once recognized as an option list, all color specification must be prefixed with \verb|color=|.

Note that the document is ordered by category, like doors, houses, etc. Note however that every main category can have multiple sub categories (the sub-identifier), where one sub category is by one author, meaning that for each main category you might find several further interpretations and variants of it. 

The rule for the sub-categories' name is ``descriptor--author--ID''. ID is to enumerate over different symbols, whereas the author field allows multiple people to contribute their work without incurring a name clash.

\subsection*{More symbols required?}

You might be here because you require some (non-mathematical) symbol... Thus, two pieces of advice:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Check out \url{https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html}: it allows you to draw a symbol in the browser, and text recognition recommends \LaTeX{} commands and the packages in which they are found.
  \item Other than that, one might only need this amazing PDF:
  \url{https://tug.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf}. 
  It lists out dozens (or hundreds?) of packages and their symbols, including their commands and symbols. Thus, either scroll through its almost 500 pages, or use full-text search, e.g., for ``dinosaur''.  
\end{itemize}

If you still don't find what you are after, please consider drawing variants of what you need yourself using ChatGPT in Ti\textit{k}z, and ``donate'' your work into this package so that it grows. :)

\section{Doors}

In this section, you find multiple variants of doors.


\subsection{floorplan--pascal}

Author: package author (Pascal; using ChatGPT).

\begin{itemize}
  \foreach \i in {01,02,03,04} {
    \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol\{door\}\{floorplan--pascal-\i\}} \dotfill\
          \everydaySymbol{door}{floorplan--pascal-\i}
  }

    % item 5 is shown separately as otherwise, strangely, the symbols are not perfectly aligned
    \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol\{door\}\{floorplan--pascal-05\}} \dotfill\
          \everydaySymbol{door}{floorplan--pascal-05}

    \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol[color=red!66!yellow]\{door\}\{floorplan--pascal-05\}} \dotfill\
          \everydaySymbol[color=red!66!yellow]{door}{floorplan--pascal-05}

    \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol[blue]\{door\}\{floorplan--pascal-05\}} \dotfill\
          \everydaySymbol[blue]{door}{floorplan--pascal-05}
\end{itemize}



\section{Houses}

In this section, you find multiple variants of houses.

\subsection{iconic--pascal}

Author: package author (Pascal; using ChatGPT).

Note that here you have only one main command and use the config key to configure your graphic.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol\{house\}\{iconic--pascal\}} \dotfill\
        \everydaySymbol{house}{iconic--pascal}

  \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol[config=\{middleDoor,chimney\}]\{house\}\{iconic--pascal\}} \dotfill\
        \everydaySymbol[config={middleDoor,chimney}]{house}{iconic--pascal}

  \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol[config=\{rightDoor,leftWindow\}]\{house\}\{iconic--pascal\}} \dotfill\
        \everydaySymbol[config={rightDoor,leftWindow}]{house}{iconic--pascal}

  \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol[config=twoWindows,color=red]\{house\}\{iconic--pascal\}} \dotfill\
        \everydaySymbol[config=twoWindows,color=red]{house}{iconic--pascal}

  \item \texttt{\string\everydaySymbol[config=\{twoWindows,middleDoor\}]\{house\}\{iconic--pascal\}} \dotfill\
        \everydaySymbol[config={twoWindows,middleDoor}]{house}{iconic--pascal}

\end{itemize}

\section{Snow}

In this section, you find anything related to snow. 

\subsection{snowflake--john}

Author: johnzhou721 (John; snowflake shape using ChatGPT, but significantly tweaked).

As always, you can specify colors using \texttt{color=\meta{some-color}}, or by \emph{only} providing a color as (optional) argument. Using \texttt{colorful=true} uses some default blue and purple color, made by the designer.  With using \texttt{colorful=false} or not specifying this at all, draws the snowflake in black or the color specified. Note that the colors you specify are subject to opacity. The \texttt{colorful} switch overrides the colors you specify manually. In addition, note that you \emph{must} specify \texttt{=true} or \texttt{=false} on \texttt{colorful}, else \texttt{colorful} is parsed as a (non-existent) color.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|\everydaySymbol[colorful=true]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}| \dotfill\ \everydaySymbol[colorful=true]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}
  \item \verb|\everydaySymbol[colorful=false]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}| \dotfill\ \everydaySymbol[colorful=false]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}
  \item \verb|\everydaySymbol{snow}{snowflake--john-01}| \dotfill\ \everydaySymbol{snow}{snowflake--john-01}
  \item \verb|\everydaySymbol[color=blue]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}| \dotfill\ \everydaySymbol[color=blue]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}
  \item \verb|\everydaySymbol[color=red]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}| \dotfill\ \everydaySymbol[color=red]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}
  \item \verb|\everydaySymbol[purple]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}| \dotfill\ \everydaySymbol[purple]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}
  \item \verb|\everydaySymbol[colorful=true,color=yellow]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}| \dotfill\ \everydaySymbol[colorful=true,color=yellow]{snow}{snowflake--john-01}
\end{itemize}



\section*{Version History}
